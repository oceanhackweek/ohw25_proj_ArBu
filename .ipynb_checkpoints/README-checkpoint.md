# ohw25_proj_ArBu


**Folder Structure**

* `contributor_folders` Each contributor can make a folder here and 
push their work here during the week. This will allow everyone to see each others work but prevent any merge conflicts. It is good if participants are new to collaborative coding.
* `final_notebooks` When the team develops shared final notebooks, they 
can be shared here. Make sure to communicate so that you limit merge conflicts.
* `scripts` Shared scripts or functions can be added here - for now we will keep our scripts in our collaborator folders
* `data` All of our data are in the shared-public drive under /shared-public/OHW25/ohw25_proj_ArBu/

You can start with a simple structure and as you progress you can refine it to contain more components. [Here](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/#directory-structure) is an example of a more elaborate structure for a data science project.

## Project Name

Argo + Buoys + Hurricanes

## One-line Description

2025 Ocean Hackweek project analyzing Argo float and buoy data to visualize biogeochemical signals during hurricanes. 

## Current Tasks (update as we go)

Stevie:
DeMarcus:
Hafeez:
* 
Joohyeun:


## Planning

Workflow: each collaborator has their own folder & branch

1. every 8 hours, run gh-scoped-creds in terminal to have access to OHW Git (follow instructions in terminal from there) 
2. download and access float and buoy data from /shared-public/OHW25/ohw25_proj_ArBu/ (everyone has permission to read and write from the shared-public folder)
3. commit code updates from /ohw25_proj_ArBu/contributor_folders/

## Planning

* Initial idea: "short description"
* Ideation Presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14JyNPC2JicP1IkHbWcDI0xt0FRbDmtdW4NTQo8wN80M/edit?usp=sharing
* Slack channel: ohw25_proj_ArBu
* Project google drive: Add link
* Final presentation: Add link when ready

## Background

Argo map: https://fleetmonitoring.euro-argo.eu/dashboard?Status=Active

## Goals

Gain skills: working with Argo toolboxes (R & python), analyzing new datasets, visualizing oceanographic datasets

## Datasets

BGC-Argo
Buoys - ndbc, cdip, cman
